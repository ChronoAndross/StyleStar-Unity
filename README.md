### Some Notes

This was developed using Unity version 2018.4.15f1, it could probably be updated without issue.
You may need to enable TextMesh Pro? Unsure.
 
 
### Unzip font asset file!

In `Assets/Fonts`, unzip `librefranklin-mplus SDF.zip` right to the same folder, so the `*.asset` file is here.
